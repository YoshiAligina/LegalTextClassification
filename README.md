# Yoshita Aligina's CS439 Final Project

This project focuses on classifying legal text documents into predefined categories to improve efficiency in legal research. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to handle unstructured legal text, transforming it into  embeddings for classification and clustering based on domain knowledge.
